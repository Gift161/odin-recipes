    <h2>What Are Chocolate Crinkle Cookies?</h2>

    <p>Chocolate crinkle cookies have become a holiday staple, but they're also great any time of year. They're cake-like cookies made with unsweetened cocoa powder, vegetable oil, and a handful of other pantry staple ingredients.</p>

    <p>Before baking, the cookies are coated in confectioners' sugar. When they bake up, they end up with a cracked (or "crinkled") effect.</p>
    
    <p>They're the perfect cookie for brownie or Devil's food cake lovers because of their rich, fudgy flavor and texture.</p>

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
